# What does: 11 + 1 / 6  evaluate to ?

# Solution:
11 + 1 / 6

# Calculate 10 plus 2 all divided by 3 and then squared

# Solution:
((10+2)/3)^2



# Storing values
a <- 8              # assign the number 3 to OBJECT (variable) called "a"
b <- 5              # assign 5 to b

a                   # so what's the value of OBJECT "a"
b                   # ... and what's b

a + b               # we can add them together just like numbers

# Exercise

# What happens if we change a and then re-add a and b? [Hint: Try it now]
a <- 8
a+b
# Does it work if you just change a in the script and then add a and b? [Hint: Try it]
a+b
# Did you still get the same answer after you changed a? 
# If so, why do you think that might be?
#
# We can also assign the result of a + b to a new variable, c. 
# How would you do this?

# Solution:
c <- a+b

# Weâ€™ve seen that vectors can be of type character, 
# numeric (or double), integer, and logical. 
#
# But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?
#
# eg:
#
#   thing <- c("some characters", 3.141, 100, TRUE)
#   thing
#   class(thing)
#
# What will happen in each of these examples?
#
#   num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
#   num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
#   char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
#   tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")

# [Hint: use class() to check the data type of your objects]

# Can you explain why you think it happens?

heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)

# Exercise (extended)

#
# Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector 
# with the NAs removed.

#   heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
#
# Solution

# Use the function median() to calculate the median of the heights vector.
#
# Solution

# Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.
#
# [Hint: R has a builtin function called length() that tells you 
# how many values are in a vector
